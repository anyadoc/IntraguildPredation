# IntraguildPredation
Intraguild Predation Benefits the Killing Species in Communities with Shared Pathogens. 
Intraguild predation (IGP) is a common phenomenon among within animal communities and is generally considered a product of competition
for resources. Here we show how IGP can also be supported by the benefits that accrue to the less abundant killing species when it kills
members of the more common subordinate species and thereby reduces the critical community size for shared pathogens. 
We build simple two-species deterministic susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) models wherein the species are linked via interspecific
pathogen transmission as well as IGP.
