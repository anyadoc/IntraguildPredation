# IntraguildPredation
Intraguild Predation Benefits the Killing Species in Communities with Shared Pathogens. Matthew E. Gompper and Aniruddha V. Belsare Department of Fisheries &amp; Wildlife Sciences, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, 65211 USA (gompperm@missouri.edu; belsarea@missouri.edu)  Intraguild predation (IGP) is a common phenomenon among within animal communities and is generally considered a product of competition for resources. Here we show how IGP can also be supported by the benefits that accrue to the less abundant killing species when it kills members of the more common subordinate species and thereby reduces the critical community size for shared pathogens. We build simple two-species deterministic susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) models wherein the species are linked via interspecific pathogen transmission as well as IGP.
